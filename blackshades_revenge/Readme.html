keep your VIP (the guy in white) alive as long as possible. The
assassins will all try to shoot or stab him to death. You must do all
you can to prevent this. Your reputation has preceded you, so the VIP
has absolute confidence in your abilities and will completely ignore
all the assassins. When an assassin is aiming at your VIP with a gun,
you will psychicly see a line of sight extending from him to your
VIP. This line will narrow and redden until it disappears and the
assassin fires. Depending on the situation it may be best just to
shoot the assassin(s), or to dive and tackle the VIP to the ground to
avoid the bullet. Unfortunately your psychic powers do not show the
line of sight of knife-wielding assassins.<BR><BR>If you are feeling
overwhelmed you can use psychic aiming to temporarily speed up your
thought processes and aim your shots better. If there are no visible
enemies you may want to release your soul and look for nearby
enemies. When your soul is released your VIP pulsates between blue
and red, civilians between black and red, and assassins are solid
red.<BR><BR>If you die or your VIP is killed.. the level restarts. If
you are are interested in the theory behind this: you are a psychic
bodyguard, so you can see small distances into the future. The
failure only occured in a possible future which you are now going to
try and avoid.<BR><BR><B><U>Scoring: </U></B><BR>150 points for a
successful disarm<BR>300 points for destroying a zombie (by blowing
its head off)<BR>100+50x points for completing a mission where x is
the mission number (i.e. 450 points for completing mission 3)<BR>75
points for incapacitating an assassin<BR>+50 if he had a knife<BR>-300
points for hurting a civilian<BR>-200 points for allowing the VIP to
die<BR>The penalty for failing to protect the VIP is halved if you
kill the assassin.<BR><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><B><U>Custom Levels:</U></B><BR>You can
edit levels by setting &quot;Custom levels&quot; to 1 in the config
and editing the customlevels.txt file in the data
folder.<BR><BR><B><U>Weapons:</U></B><BR>Bare Hands: Smack people
with them. Or if you want to be nice, walk or stand (don't run) near
somebody with a gun and take it away.<BR><BR><B>Knife:</B> Like bare
hands, but deadly and with longer range. Look out for knife-wielding
assassins, they are the most dangerous.<BR><BR><B>Handgun:</B> One
shot with this should be enough to incapacitate any human target, but
they may remain conscious for a second (this can be bad if they are
about to stab your VIP, aim for the head)<BR><BR><B>Magnum:</B> Not
as much ammo as the vanilla handgun, but one shot is an instantenous
kill<BR><BR><B>Assault Rifle:</B> This weapon has quite a kick and is
bigger and more unwieldy than the handguns, but it has a large
magazine and can fire quickly if necessary<BR><BR><B>Sniper Rifle:</B>
A bit more powerful than the magnum, with a scope. Very difficult to
aim unless you are zoomed in (zoom by holding the control
key)<BR><BR><B>Shotgun:</B> Aim and shoot. Very powerful but somewhat
inaccurate.<BR><BR><B>Grenade:</B> Hold down the mouse button to take
out the pin, release the button to throw it. Crouch to change your
mind and put <BR>the pin back in. You can knock people out if you hit
them in the head, or of course you can just blow them to
pieces.<BR><BR>
<B><U>Inverted Mouse and Config.txt</U></B><BR>Windows users can change the invert mouse element in 
config.txt to 1 to activate inverted vertical mouse behavior.<BR><BR>

testers, and to artist David Drew for modelling the assault rifle,
sniper rifle, handgun, shotgun and grenade.</P>

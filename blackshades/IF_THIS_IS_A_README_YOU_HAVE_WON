Right now it's all compiling...

untar that in the Data/ dir to get the targas until somebody adds png support.
See "Readme" for the developer's original, which of course contains notes on playing the game and such.
Additional things we added:
Ctrl+G to grab/ungrab the cursor
ALT+Enter to switch to fullscreen and back again

Note that you need reasonably new OpenAL libs from
http://opensource.creative.com/
Most distros which have openal at all, probably won't have the latest and greatest.
For instance I'm told openal in debian unstable is from 2001. 
If you don't want to update your OpenAL, you can add -DDEBIAN_NEEDS_TO_UPDATE_THEIR_OPENAL
Complaints about the name of the #define will be nulled ;-)

If you want fullscreen at startup, currently you have to -DFULLSCREEN.
I don't suggest doing this in OS X however as it seems to have a porblem keeping the mouse properly grabbed, thus requiring some key combination.

If you're on a platform where you A) Don't have Ogg Vorbis support in your OpenAL, or B) Like to redownload large wav files, be my guest and -DNOOGG and get http://filesingularity.timedoctor.org/Data.tar.bz2 for the wavs

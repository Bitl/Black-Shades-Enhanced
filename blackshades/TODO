What Ryan said about it:
"I don't have the source in front of me, but it looks like the people walk
correctly, but keep deciding to change their destination...this is likely
because we're reading the path model wrong or something. I don't know.
There's path determination code that if you comment it out, everyone
walks in a straight line, so that's the problem. Whether it's the
determination code itself or what it bases its calculation on...I have no
idea."

What Toby did:
Something, I dunno, here's his explanation;

"Staring deep into the barely commented depths of Black Shades, I tried 
out Ryan's idea about the pathfinding that you put in the ToDo file. 
Having acheived the everyone walking in straight lines effect, I set 
about a bit of hackery.

In GameTick.cpp, the variable realcheck is a trigger for a lot of the 
pathfinding stuff. It checks whether we are at the end of our path, or 
we are moving away from our target. I have no idea why the second bit 
isn't working properly - maybe there is some funny updating going on for 
either oldplayercoords or playercoords. Commenting out the second check 
gets the game working with a more believable collection of moving people."

And this was the patch:
